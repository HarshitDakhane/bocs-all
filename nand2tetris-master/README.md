# nand2tetris
## Nand2Tetris Projects 0 - 11
Includes the following:
* Logic gates built in HDL
* Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) built in HDL 
* RAM built in HDL
* CPU built in HDL
* Assembler, written in Java, translating Assembly language code into binary code
* Virtual Machine Language Translator, written in Java, translating VM language code into Assembly language code
* Compiler, written in Java, compiling the Jack programming language into VM language code
* A Snake game, written in the simple Jack programming language, that can run on the final computer system

## Issues I'm Working On
* The Compiler (both parts - Project 10 and 11) passes the dry tests that come with Nand2Tetris, but there are some wet tests not provided with the course that it throws an infinite loop in. I'm thinking this is due to the comment parsing.
